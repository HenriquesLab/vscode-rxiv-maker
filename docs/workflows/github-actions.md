## 🔧 How GitHub Actions Works

Rxiv-Maker uses GitHub Actions with containerized execution to automatically:
- **Fast setup**: Uses pre-compiled Docker images (2 min vs. 10+ min dependency installation)
- **Reproducible environment**: Identical LaTeX, Python, and R versions across all builds
- **Docker acceleration**: Pre-compiled container images eliminate the need for runtime dependency installation
- **Figure generation**: Execute Python/R scripts and Mermaid diagrams
- **PDF compilation**: Convert Markdown to LaTeX and compile to publication-quality PDF
- **Automated releases**: Create releases with downloadable PDFs

### Performance Benefits
- **⚡ 5x faster builds**: Pre-compiled Docker images reduce build time from ~10 minutes to ~2 minutes
- **🔒 Guaranteed reproducibility**: Container images ensure identical environment across builds
- **🌐 Cross-platform consistency**: Same results regardless of runner platform
- **📦 Dependency isolation**: No conflicts with existing system packages or installations

### When PDFs are Generated

The workflow triggers in two ways:

1. **Manual Trigger** (Recommended for beginners):
   - Go to Actions tab → "Build and Release PDF" → "Run workflow"
   - Choose manuscript path and click "Run workflow"

2. **Automatic Trigger** (For advanced users):
   - When you push a **git tag** (e.g., `v1.0.0`)
   - Uses `.env` file configuration or defaults to `EXAMPLE_MANUSCRIPT`

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### ❌ "Workflow failed" - No PDF generated

**Problem**: The workflow runs but fails to generate PDF

**Solutions**:
1. **Run validation first**: Use `make validate` locally to catch issues before pushing
2. **Check manuscript path**: Ensure the directory exists and has required files
3. **Verify file structure**: Must have `00_CONFIG.yml` and `01_MAIN.md`
4. **Check Python scripts**: Ensure figure generation scripts are valid
5. **Review workflow logs**: Click on failed workflow → click on "build-pdf" job → check red X steps

#### ❌ "LaTeX compilation failed"

**Problem**: LaTeX cannot compile your document

**Solutions**:
1. **Check LaTeX syntax**: Ensure your Markdown converts to valid LaTeX
2. **Verify citations**: Check `03_REFERENCES.bib` file syntax
3. **Review special characters**: Some characters need escaping
4. **Check figure references**: Ensure all referenced figures exist

#### ❌ "Figure generation failed"

**Problem**: Python or Mermaid figures cannot be generated

**Solutions**:
1. **Check Python scripts**: Ensure scripts can run without errors
2. **Verify data files**: Check that data files exist in `FIGURES/DATA/`
3. **Review imports**: Ensure all required packages are in `pyproject.toml`
4. **Check file paths**: Use relative paths within the FIGURES directory

#### ❌ "Permission denied" or "File not found"

**Problem**: Workflow cannot access files or directories

**Solutions**:
1. **Check repository permissions**: Ensure Actions are enabled
2. **Verify file names**: Check exact spelling and case
3. **Check .gitignore**: Ensure manuscript files aren't ignored
4. **Verify branch**: Ensure you're working on the correct branch

### Debug Steps

1. **Check workflow logs**:
   - Actions tab → Click on failed run → Click on "build-pdf" → Expand red X steps

2. **Test locally first**:
   ```bash
   make validate MANUSCRIPT_PATH=your_manuscript  # Check for issues first
   make pdf MANUSCRIPT_PATH=your_manuscript       # Then generate PDF
   ```

3. **Use example manuscript**:
   - Try with `EXAMPLE_MANUSCRIPT` first to ensure workflow works

4. **Run validation locally**:
   ```bash
   # Quick validation check
   make validate MANUSCRIPT_PATH=MANUSCRIPT
   
   # Detailed validation with suggestions
   python src/py/scripts/validate_manuscript.py --detailed MANUSCRIPT
   ```

5. **Check file structure**:
   ```bash
   ls -la MANUSCRIPT/
   # Should show: 00_CONFIG.yml, 01_MAIN.md, FIGURES/, etc.
   ```

### Advanced Troubleshooting
